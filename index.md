Section A02: Sepsis - Using Clinical Healthcare Data Science to Identify and Combat an Infectious Killer
Mentor Kyle Shannon

- What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
  The most interesting topic we discussed this quarter is the illness scores. It gave me new perspective about quantifying how sick a patient is.
- Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
  A potential investigation would be checking if there are any patterns in the timeline from the patients intake to the sepsis diagnosis and from sepsis diagnosis to sepsis shock.
- What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
  I would probably have the architecture of our project set more rigorously as we had to change it multiple times over the development of our project.
- What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
  I would love to use LLM APIs and integrate it in giving insights to the doctors to help in sepsis treatment.
